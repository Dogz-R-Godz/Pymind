1: more optomised for numpy
2: actually works (fingers crossed)
3: changing the data types from dict to array, if we have a network that has 2 input neurons, 2 middle neurons, and 2 output neurons, the network array would be like: 
[   
    [
        0.3, #i0-m0
        0.2, #i1-m0
        0.6, #i0-m1
        -0.9 #i1-m1
    ],
    [
        -0.5,#m0-o0
        0.3, #m1-o0
        0.4, #m0-o1
        0.7  #m1-o1
    ]
]
if it was in a list.
